A chrome/firefox extension allow user to **set any video or image to fit the browser viewport size**. (Similar to [Fullscreen Anything](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/fullscreen-anything/olcfgpmjldkkjdclidhcbonieibfhhdh), but more configurable.) **Auto Fullscreen is still under development**, but it's already quite usable and most features have been implemented. For anyone who is interested now, you have to download from release page or "npm run build" yourself.
