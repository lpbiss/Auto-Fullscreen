Auto Fullscreen is a chrome/firefox extension allow user to **set any video or image to fit the browser viewport size**. (Similar to [Fullscreen Anything](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/fullscreen-anything/olcfgpmjldkkjdclidhcbonieibfhhdh), but it's kind of obsolete and does not work properly in some websites. My overall goal is to write a better replacement for it.) 

**Auto Fullscreen is still under development**, although most features have already been implemented. Currently, I do not recommend any one to try this extension.
